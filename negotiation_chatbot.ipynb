Both chatbots engage in price negotiation with users, offering and adjusting prices based on user input. The second model enhances this by incorporating sentiment analysis, providing context-aware, sentiment-driven responses. This chatbot can be used to simulate price negotiations with AI that adapts to user interaction."
