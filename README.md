# negotiation_chatbot
This chatbot initiates a negotiation for product pricing, allowing the user to accept, reject, or propose a counteroffer. It uses AI to set a price range, offering discounts or counteroffers based on input. Integration with a language model handles conversation, with optional sentiment analysis for better deals based on user tone.
